\section{Overview}

\begin{frame}{``Causal Inference''}

 \textit{Causal inference} is about design and analysis of experiments
 and observational studies so as to create fair comparisons that
 enable you to measure effects of interventions.


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label=whatWeWillCoverFr]{Methods we'll study in the course}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Randomization-based analysis for experiments
  \item Natural experiments, quasi-experiments,
    difference-in-differences
  \item Effect estimation \& inference in the presence of interference 
  \item Propensity scores, propensity score matching
%  \item Regression discontinuity
  \item Omitted variable sensitivity analysis
  \item Instrumental variables \& principal stratification
  \item \ldots
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\Note{Don't linger, I come back to this slide after Causal Inference
  in Experiments section}

\begin{frame}{Three traditions in quantitative analysis}
\framesubtitle{A brief, tendentious review}

Modern causal inference in the 19th c., emerges over the 20th c, hits
it stride during this century. Dominant strains of quantitative
analysis in social science, by century:

\begin{itemize}
\item[19th] social physics
\item[20th] sampling of populations
\item[21st] causal inference (a prediction)
\end{itemize}

  
\end{frame}

\section{Causal inference in simple experiments}

\begin{frame}{Centrality of experiment to modern CI}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Experiments are conceptually and practically central
  \item Not just any experiments, particular types, featuring
    \textit{control groups} and \textit{random assignment}
  \item Central characteristics of an ideal situation
  \item The ideal reveals its merits in a variety of disciplines over
    the 20th c.  
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Two influential examples}
\begin{frame}{Example 1a: The Salk vaccine trial\footnote{Source:

\begin{frame}{The other Salk trial}

\igrphx{SalkVtable-full}
\end{frame}
\itnote{
\item Explain differences
\item both versions are experiments in the everyday sense
\item both control for age and physical locale
\item large size, presence of these controls lends legitimacy to both
\item Demonstration of advantage of random assigment per se
\item We'll see how to get the ``right answer'', despite shortcomings.  The move is
  primarily conceptual, not technical, having to do w/ IVs.
}

\subsection{Conceptual framework}
\begin{frame}{Goals of experimental design}

Experiment design aims to create a situation in which causation is
readily detected. If the putative causes
really do have their intended effects, you'll tend to see it; if they
don't, you'll tend not to.
\pause

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Given these goals, \textit{random
    assignment}  sure helps. Units 1-3 theorize this point along lines
  of Fisher, Neyman and their current-day followers.
\item In comparative assessments of study designs, random assignment also benefits
  from its association with other design characteristics of
  high-quality studies:  distinctions among covariates, treatments and
  outcomes; comparability of treatment and control groups; \ldots;
  formal study planning (Rosenbaum, \textit{DOS}, ch. 1.)

\begin{frame}{Interference}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Intuitively, my treatment may affect your response
  \item If there is interference, describing the true state of affairs calls for more elaborate notation that $(y_{T1}, Y_{C1}), (y_{T2}, Y_{C2}), \ldots, (y_{Tn}, Y_{Cn}).$
  \item Nonetheless, possibility of interference does not threaten validity of tests of Fisher's null.
