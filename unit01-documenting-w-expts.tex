\section{Overview}

\begin{frame}{``Causal Inference''}

 \textit{Causal inference} is about design and analysis of randomized and nonrandomized studies, aiming to create meaningful comparisons that justify inferences about causation with varying, but clearly specified, degrees of certainty.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label=whatWeWillCoverFr]{Methods we'll study in the course}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Randomization-based analysis for experiments
  \item Natural experiments, quasi-experiments,
    difference-in-differences
  \item Effect estimation \& inference in the presence of interference 
  \item Propensity scores, propensity score matching
%  \item Regression discontinuity
  \item Omitted variable sensitivity analysis
  \item Instrumental variables \& principal stratification
  \item \ldots
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Three traditions in quantitative analysis}
\framesubtitle{A brief, tendentious review}

Modern causal inference in the 19th c., emerges over the 20th c, hits
it stride during this century. Dominant strains of quantitative
analysis in social science, by century:

\begin{itemize}
\item[19th] social physics
\item[20th] sampling of populations
\item[21st] causal inference (BH prediction)
\end{itemize}

  
\end{frame}

\section{Causal inference in simple experiments}

\begin{frame}{Centrality of experiment to modern CI}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Experiments are conceptually and practically central
  \item Not just any experiments, particular types, featuring
    \textit{control groups} and \textit{random assignment}
  \item Central characteristics of an ideal situation
  \item The ideal reveals its merits in a variety of disciplines over
    the 20th c.  
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  primarily conceptual, not technical, having to do w/ IVs.
}

\subsection{Conceptual framework}
\begin{frame}{Goals of experimental design}

Experiment design aims to create a situation in which causation is
readily detected, in the following sense. First, if the putative causes
really do have their intended effects, they'll manifest themselves in
such a way that the inference of causation is natural to make. Second,
when such inferences suggest themselves they also withstand scrutiny, in
that logic reveals that either the inference of causation was correct or
a freak occurrence, something objectively unlikely, has occurred.

\pause
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Given these goals, the contribution of \textit{random
    assignment} is central.  The first weeks of this course revisit
  Fisher's [1935] argument for the primacy of random assignment.
\item In comparative assessments of study designs, random assignment also benefits
  from its association with other design characteristics of
  high-quality studies:  distinctions among covariates, treatments and
  outcomes; comparability of treatment and control groups; \ldots;
  formal study planning (Rosenbaum, \textit{DOS}, ch. 1.)

\section{Matching in nonrandomized studies}

\begin{frame}[label=CIFr]{``Causal inference'' again}

`Causal inference'' is about design and analysis of randomized and
nonrandomized studies with goals:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Meaningful comparisons, ie comparisons that reveal causation (if present) simply and w/ minimal overhead;
\item On scrutiny, EITHER indicated causation occurred OR \ldots
\end{enumerate}


(where a short, circumscribed list follows the ``OR'')

\begin{frame}{Common design aspects of randomized studies}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Common properties of small, simple experiments:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item balanced 
    \item complete
    \item simple (same $\mathrm{Pr}(Z=z)$'s)
    \end{itemize}
  \item<2-> Common complications:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<2-> pairs
    \item<2-> blocks
    \item<2-> cluster-level assignment
    \end{itemize}
  \item<3-> We'll handle complications by simplification, reorganizing so that we're looking at 1 or more simpler studies.
  \item<4-> (Same considerations will apply to non-randomized studies.)
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Exclusion restriction}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Intuitively, \textit{exclusion restriction} is assumption that $Z$ didn't affect anything other than the treatment that might in turn have affected outcomes.
  \item More formal definition to come, and in Gerber\& Green ch 2.
  \item Blinding and exclusion restriction
  \item an issue in both RCTs and obs studies
  \item<2-> Does not threaten validity of tests of Fisher's null
  \item<2-> (but may well affect interpretation) 
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Interference}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Intuitively, my treatment may affect your response
  \item If there is interference, describing the true state of affairs calls for more elaborate notation that $(y_{T1}, Y_{C1}), (y_{T2}, Y_{C2}), \ldots, (y_{Tn}, Y_{Cn}).$
  \item Nonetheless, possibility of interference does not threaten validity of tests of Fisher's null.
