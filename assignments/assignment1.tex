\begin{enumerate}
\item Confirm to your own satisfaction that for analysis of the coffee experiment, the simulation method can approximate the exact, permutation-based calculation to as much accuracy as is practically meaningful.
\item Does the chi-square procedure report a similar p-value?  (In R,
  it's \texttt{chisq.test()}. For documentation, enter \texttt{?chisq.test}.)
\item For this data set, are the chi-square test and the fisher test
  both admissible? (Hint: read R's warnings and documentation.  Can
  you remember the conditions for the chi-square test for two-way
  tables, from a previous stats class?)
\item Use your simulation to approximate $\mathrm{E} \left[n_{1}^{-1}\mathbf{Z}'\mathbf{y}\right] $ and
  $\mathrm{Var}\left[n_{1}^{-1}\mathbf{Z}'\mathbf{y}\right] $. 
\item Calculate $\mathrm{E}  \left[n_{1}^{-1}\mathbf{Z}'\mathbf{y}\right] $, the exact expected value of the
  sample mean, from first principles.  
 %% Should one state, ``calculate ... , the expected value of the sample mean under the strict null hypothesis of no effect, from first principles''? Or do you want students to reason that, since the y vector is lowercase (and hence fixed), we are implictly invoking Fisher's null?
\item In this setup, $\mathrm{Var}\, \left[n_{1}^{-1}\mathbf{Z}'\mathbf{y}\right]  = n_{1}^{-1}
  \frac{n_{0}}{n} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i} - \bar y)^{2}}{n-1} $.
  If you've seen formulas for the sample variance in earlier stats
  courses, you probably saw
  $$
  \mathrm{Var} \left[\bar{y}\right] = \frac{\sigma_{y}^{2}}{n_{1}} = \frac{1}{n_{1}}
  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i} - \bar y)^{2}}{n} .
  $$
Which of the two formulas gives a larger value?  Explain why it makes
sense that the formula we've given would differ the direction it does
from this other formula, in terms of the difference between this
sampling situation and the sampling model that more commonly
accompanies the Central Limit Theorem.
\item Calculate $ \mathrm{Var}\, \left[n_{1}^{-1}\mathbf{Z}'\mathbf{y}\right] $ using the appropriate
  formula. 
\item Determine the normal theory approximation to
  $\mathrm{Pr}_{0}(n_{1}^{-1}\mathbf{Z}'\mathbf{y} =1 ) $.  (To do this in R, use
  \texttt{pnorm()}; type \texttt{?pnorm} for help. It's a good idea to
  check your answer against some 
  more user-friendly Normal table; you'll find one of these quickly
  using any search engine.)
