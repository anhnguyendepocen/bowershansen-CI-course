A researcher plans to ask six subjects to donate time to an adult
literacy program. Each subject will be asked to donate either 30
($Z=0$) or 60 ($Z=1$)
minutes. The researcher is considering three methods for randomizing
the treatment. Method I is to make independent decisions for each
subject, tossing a coin each time. Method C is to
write ``30'' and ``60'' on three playing cards each, and then shuffle
the six cards. Method P tosses one coin for each of the 3 pairs
$(1,2)$, $(3,4)$, $(5,6)$, asking for 30 (60) minutes from exactly one
member of each pair. 

\begin{itemize}
\item[a] Calculate $\mathrm{E}\left[\mathbf{Z}'\mathbf{Z}\right]$ under each of the three methods.
\item[b] For which of the methods does $\mathrm{E}
  \left[\mathbf{Z}'\mathbf{Z} -\mathrm{E} \left[\mathbf{Z}'\mathbf{Z}\right]\right]^{2} =
  0$?\footnote{I.e., for which does
    $\mathrm{Var}\left[\mathbf{Z}'\mathbf{Z}\right] = 0$?  (In general,
    $\mathrm{Var}\left[V\right] = \mathrm{E} \left[V - \mathrm{E}(V) \right]^{2} $.)}
\item[c] ``$\mathrm{E} \left[\frac{\mathbf{Z}'\mathbf{x}}{\mathbf{Z}'\mathbf{Z}}\right]$''
  is another way of writing ``the treatment group
  \underline{\hspace{3em}} of $x$.''  Fill in the blank.
  %% What should students put here? Is it something like ``the expected value of the treatment group mean of x''? Or should students just put ``the treatment group mean of x''? I was a little unclear because of the wording.
\item[d] For two of the three methods, algebraic principles we've seen
  let you can reduce
  $\mathrm{E} \left[\frac{\mathbf{Z}'\mathbf{x}}{\mathbf{Z}'\mathbf{Z}}\right]$ to a
  familiar function of $(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{6}) $.  Which 2 are
  these, and why doesn't the same thing work for the third?
\end{itemize}
