# Lingering questions:

 - Standard errors for experimental (or as-if experimental) estimators of average treatment effects?
 - What is coverage and why do we care? (And how might we know whether we have good or bad coverage?)

# Today:

The testing approach. Testing the sharp null of no effects. Different test statistics can convert tests of the sharp null into tests of other hypotheses. (ex. Testing the null of no positive effects despite a negative ate.)

# Tomorrow:

Methods not primarily about matching. Recall IV. Now RDD and Diff in Diffs.
