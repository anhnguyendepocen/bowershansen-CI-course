## Lingering questions and thoughts

Last time we talked about different ideas about causality, about the misunderstandings about how methods of observation and description (numbers, words, etc..) relate to conceptualizations of causality (i.e. a linear regression is neither a research design nor does it require one conception of what cause means, similarly, ethnography does not commit a person to any particular understanding of causality). Here we talked some more about what we called Hume's approach.

We also talked more about how Fisher and Neyman engaged with the problem of counterfactual causal inference. 

And we noted that large samples are not an inherent requirement for statistical inference about causal claims.
