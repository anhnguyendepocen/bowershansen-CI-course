# Lingering questions:

Last time you asked about why we would teach about propensity scores given existing criticisms.
And you wanted to know about propensity scores and mahalanobis distances.

We didn't really talk about debates about balance testing.

# Today

One more day of practice with the tools of multivariate matching. Again, I
provide some code in order to raise questions, but you should feel free to just
match on, say, a Mahalanobis distance matrix, maybe without ranks, or just
propensity scores, or just baseline homicides, or something else. The idea is
to get comfortable with reasoning about making matched designs.

The handout also engages with some questions that arise: for example, when
should I stop fiddling around? Or, "I have a computer, can I use it to avoid so
much fiddling around?")

# Tomorrow

We get into estimating average causal effects after you have a matched design
that you are happy to use in an "as-if random" fashion.
