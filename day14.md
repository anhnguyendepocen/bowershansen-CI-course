## What to read?


I recommend the chapters in Rosenbaum 2010 (DOS) on matching as well as Hansen (2004) and Hansen (2011) [a case study of matching].

We will soon distributed another list of supplementary readings so that you can get more conceptual background before and/or after our moments in class together.


# Questions from the Past

 - History of matching.
 - Why match?
 - Why assess balance?
 - What does it mean to use xBalance for outcome analysis versus balance testing?

# Today

 - How can we show that a method of estimating a causal effect is a good method? What do we mean by good?
 - When we have a block-randomized experiment in which treatment probabilities vary by block (or a matched observational study with unequal block sizes), how should we estimate a causal effect?

We propose that we spend the day with you working on estimating causal effects from matched designs.

Remember, our general idea is to create a research design by matching that  balances observed covariates as well as a a block randomized design. Then we think about statistical inference in experimental framework: first we create something that resembles an experiment, and then we treat it like an experiment. Then, we assess how sensitive our results are to the pretense that we have an experiment --- in an experiment we balance all unobserved and observed covariates.

Overall:

"Estimation_of_Causal_Effects.Rnw" exercise.

# Tomorrow

What does it mean to assess "uncertainty" in an estimate of a causal effect? How should we calculate standard errors, let alone confidence intervals, for statistical inferences about causal effects?
