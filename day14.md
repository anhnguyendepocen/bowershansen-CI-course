# Questions from the Past

## What to read?

I recommend the chapters in Rosenbaum 2010 (DOS) on matching as well as Hansen (2004) and Hansen (2011) [a case study of matching].

We have distributed another list of supplementary readings so that you can get more conceptual background before and/or after our moments in class together.

# Today

We propose that we spend the day with you working on estimating causal effects from matched designs. Remember, our general idea is to create a research design by matching that  balances observed covariates as well as a a block randomized design. Then we think about statistical inference in experimental framework: first we create something that resembles an experiment, and then we treat it like an experiment. Then, we assess how sensitive our results are to the pretense that we have an experiment --- in an experiment we balance all unobserved and observed covariates. 

Overall: 

"Estimation_of_Causal_Effects.Rnw" exercise.
