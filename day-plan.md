These are the day by day plans for the second half of the course. See unit-goals-presumptions.md for broader visions of the first half of the course.

# Day 11: 7-8-2017

Weak instruments; Precision from gain scores in experiments; Balance testing in experiments; Overview of rest of the course.

# Day 12: 8-8-2017

The problem of covariance adjustment to reduce "bias"/ confounding. How can we answer the question about whether we have adjusted enough. A simple approach: stratification on one categorical variable (and interaction effects). More complex: find sets that are as similar as possible in terms of a continuous variable (bipartite matching). Balance assessment after stratification.

Reading: Gelman and Hill \S~9.5 on overlap/common support.

# Day 13: 9-8-2017

Basic forms of matching: greedy,optimal, replacement, full.
 
Matching on more than one variable, approaches: mahalanobis distance and propensity scores.


# Day 14: 10-8-2017
