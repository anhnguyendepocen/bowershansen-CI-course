These are the day by day plans for the second half of the course. See unit-goals-presumptions.md for broader visions of the first half of the course.

# Day 11: 7-8-2017

Weak instruments; Precision from gain scores in experiments; Balance testing in experiments; Overview of rest of the course.

# Day 12: 8-8-2017

The problem of covariance adjustment to reduce "bias"/ confounding. How can we answer the question about whether we have adjusted enough. A simple approach: stratification on one categorical variable (and interaction effects). More complex: find sets that are as similar as possible in terms of a continuous variable (bipartite matching). Balance assessment after stratification.

Reading: Gelman and Hill \S~9.5 on overlap/common support.

# Day 13: 9-8-2017

Basic forms of matching: greedy,optimal, replacement, full.
Matching on more than one variable, approaches: mahalanobis distance and propensity scores.

Agenda: Matching on one covariate using optmatch; Matching on more than one covariate: mahalnobis distances, propensity scores using optmatch. Practice. Skipping discussion of fullmatching vs fixed ratio matching (like pairs), and optimal vs greedy.


# Day 14: 10-8-2017
Agenda: Exact matching; Calipers; Combining matrices; Discussion of with and without-replacement matching and optimal vs greedy matching; Maybe use those tools to improve your best matched design.


# Day 15: 11-8-2017

Effective sample size; SIUP for balance testing; searching for a good match using balance, effective sample size, as well as max dist on important covariate.

Estimation and Testing after matching; Plus more on  Navigating implementation tradeoffs in matching: Information and blocked designs (some blockings have more information about treatment effects than others); Balance tests and the Sequential Intersection Union Principle
